OGPC By Saturday:

Finish exterior modeling of Headquarters (what does this mean?)
- Finalize Base Geometry, fix topology
- Add details: railings, plaques, foliage (can model seperately and reuse in game later)
- Keep in mind interior planning: discuss technical limitations / build around that
- Style doesn't matter - as more added to game things can be redone quickly.

PLAN INTERIOR LAYOUT SOON - THINGS REQUIRED NEED TO BE SOLIDIFIED FOR EXTERIOR CONFORMITY
